###Bitnoori says Hi everyone! 

### HI TO YOU!!

##Bitnoory says Hi, Patricia!

##Laura says Goodmorning! How is your day going so far? :)

##Good, but still confused by using remote and brach... how about you Laura? 

##Laura says I think some more practice would be good! If you want to try something else (e.g. branching) with Git we can try it out!

##Happy new year! I'm looking forward to starting bootcamp!!
